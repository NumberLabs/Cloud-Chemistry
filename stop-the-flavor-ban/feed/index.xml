					<description><![CDATA[9 years ago I was told to quit smoking for an operation. After 40+ years of smoking, this was hard. Until I found vaping. I used to get bronchitis every year and sometimes pneumonia. Until I started vaping, since then I HAVE NOT gotten sick. I for one know if vape stores were to be closed down, I most likely would start smoking again. Vape shops are essential to my well being. Cloud Chemistry please stay open. I can’t stand the taste of the other cheaper oils. Thank you]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It’s probably the preservative ingredients that are making ppl sickly not the liquid itself. cloud chemistry is awesome they make it fresh and right there in front of you and it’s still warm when you get it those gas station garbage brands are sitting for God knows how long and always have a funky smell and taste to them ....before I found cloud chemistry I got nauseous from vaping and now I vape only the best and it works out a lot less expensive then the pre packaged pods or liquid u can buy from internet -Gina McDaniel, Beach Lake, PA]]></description>
