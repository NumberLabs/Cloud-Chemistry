					<description><![CDATA[I have made 5 different blends through Cloud Chemistry, and each blend has been 100% top quality. I ALWAYS make my own blends because it&#039;s so unique to do it that way. 100% suggest to make your own blend, they allow up to 5 different flavors, try it out!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[9 years ago I was told to quit smoking for an operation. After 40+ years of smoking, this was hard. Until I found vaping. I used to get bronchitis every year and sometimes pneumonia. Until I started vaping, since then I HAVE NOT gotten sick. I for one know if vape stores were to be closed down, I most likely would start smoking again. Vape shops are essential to my well being. Cloud Chemistry please stay open. I can’t stand the taste of the other cheaper oils. Thank you]]></description>
