Well, that&#039;s a tough question. A lot of business has to be conducted based on faith, and usually people will tell the truth. If you feel differently about your situation, it&#039;d be best to ask the owner for specific answers. If they don&#039;t have a very precise, confident response, you may not want to trust them. Obviously we&#039;re not saying they&#039;re intentionally misleading you, but if they&#039;re misinformed or ignorant of the dangers in using certain chemicals - you&#039;re still vaping sub-par juice. In our experience however, we have found most vapor shops owners and their employees to be trustworthy, honest people who have one main goal: helping people stop smoking. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[But how can we be sure that a company that tells us that their juice is pure, isn&#039;t lying? Seriously - it&#039;s great that this article was written. I just wonder how we can apply it in real-world situations. Get back to me, Cloud Chemistry. Thanks. :)]]></description>
