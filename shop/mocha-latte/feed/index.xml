					<description><![CDATA[Throat hit and nicotine levels will depend on your own specifications so I&#039;ll stick to reviewing the flavor itself. 

The flavor is sooooo much better than I could have ever expected! The closest I can come to describing it is that it&#039;s almost like sucking the foam off of an actual mocha latte, but without the overly sweet hit you would get from the real life foam. The lead flavor is the creaminess which is what you would expect.  You then get the perfect after tones of coffee and chocolate, much like the actual drink. Incredibly smooth and almost seems to exhale with the warmth of your first breath after that first delicious sip! Definitely a flavor to sit and enjoy and let slowly roll out. Best coffee themed vapor I&#039;ve personally had so far. I&#039;ll need to play around with the PG/VG ratio to get a little harsher of a hit (for my own preferences), but this is a definite winner and will remain in my main rotation!]]></description>
