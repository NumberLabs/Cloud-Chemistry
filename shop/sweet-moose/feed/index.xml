					<description><![CDATA[I wanted to give this one a fair shot at discerning the flavor profile to determine exactly where it&#039;s going and I get a slight hint of what seems like amaretto, but there&#039;s too little flavor to it. I put some of this in a Kayfun Monster V1 which is well reputed as a flavor chasing tank and I didn&#039;t get much from it. It&#039;s mildly sweet (probably from being max VG) and there&#039;s little to no flavor. I also tried this in an Origin Genesis with 400 grade mesh and .05 kanthal ribbon wire....same result.I love the peeps at CC, but this particular flavor is meh at best.]]></description>
