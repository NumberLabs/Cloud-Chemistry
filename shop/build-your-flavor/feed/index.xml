					<description><![CDATA[I have made 5 different blends through Cloud Chemistry, and each blend has been 100% top quality. I ALWAYS make my own blends because it&#039;s so unique to do it that way. 100% suggest to make your own blend, they allow up to 5 different flavors, try it out!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t tell you how much I love this flavor. Reminds me of when I used to smoke. Almost 6 years since I quit smoking. All the taste, none of the smelly smoke. I LOVE IT!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My favorite blend and love the fast shipping!  Team is super helpful and always ready with my order. Wish they had more shops in the area to make it easier to shop and pickup in person. But like I said, I am very happy with the shipping speed and delivery.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Based on experience both in store and online, this business is very well run. I ordered juice a few times online since the pandemic started and shipping is super fast. I ordered a custom juice yesterday morning, and it got delivered to my mailbox today. This happened with my other flavors I&#039;ve previously ordered too. I love the service I get both online and in store. As someone who works in retail myself excellent customer service all around. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f44f.png" alt="üëè" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> The new juice is exactly what i ordered. Keep up the great work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/shop/build-your-flavor/#comment-5658&quot;&gt;Jesse Gregorio&lt;/a&gt;.

So, I am in Kansas City and cannot find anything like this product.  Nothing compares to the purity.  I recently had an issue when I ordered 3 of my product and received only one.  I called and the resolution was to send me more than what I ordered at no extra cost to me.  Appreciate that service!]]></description>
