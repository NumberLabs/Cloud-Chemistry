					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/shop/barbaric-bread/#comment-31056&quot;&gt;Tyrone&lt;/a&gt;.

Hello Tyrone, We regret to hear that this has been your experience. We have been forced to reformulate this recipe because the gingerbread concentrate that we were using now includes some additives that are not in compliance with our quality control standards. We have been experimenting with different concentrates in the hope of finding an adequate replacement for the gingerbread we were using, and your feedback is very helpful to us in this process. In exchange for your troubles, and also for your valuable and candid feedback, please email support[at]cloudchemistry.co, and we will be happy to comp a replacement bottle of the blend of your choice. Thank you so much for your patronage.]]></description>
