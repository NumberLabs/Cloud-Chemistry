					<description><![CDATA[So, I was piffed a bottle of this delectable delight from a good friend, Jacob. he talked it up for a while and finally got around to sending me aa bottle. I was amazed that the label actually meant what was inside. I can tell you that this is pretty darn close to Reese&#039;s peanut butter cups. I like the overall flavor profile, i can taste the chocolate, the peanut butter and the honey thats in it. ABSOLUTELY AMAZEBALLS!]]></description>
