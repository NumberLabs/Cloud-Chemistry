<p>As you most likely have heard by now on the main stream hype media, vaping is facing an existential threat, and we all need to pull together in solidarity in order to safeguard our future, and to protect our right to use safer alternatives to smoking.</p>



<p>In addition to individual states like Michigan announcing flavored eLiquid bans, now President Trump has announced that he will seek a federal ban on flavored eLiquid products. This news comes in the aftermath of a recent bout of serious lung-related illnesses that the news outlets are saying were caused by &#8220;vaping&#8221;. But is this true?</p>



<p>While health officials continue to investigate the precise causes of these illnesses, we do know one thing to be true:</p>



<p>These illnesses were most likely caused by vaporizing and inhaling oil, not eLiquid. Specifically, cannabis THC/CBD vaporizers, blackmarket cartridges, and vape-able vitamins, such as Vitamin E, are all the primary suspects. However, this distinction is not being made in headlines, causing confusion in the eyes of the general public. When people see ‚Äúvape,‚Äù they think eLiquid. As members of the vape community, we all know oil and juice are not even close to being the same thing.</p>



<p>Enhancing eLiquid with flavors not only provides a more pleasant vaping experience, it facilitates an easier transition into vaping and away from the harmfully addictive vice grip of tobacco products. Thousands of people depend on flavored eLiquid as a safer alternative to toxic, combustible cigarettes.</p>



<p>Please take a moment to sign the official <em>We The People Petition</em> to get our voices in front of policy makers who have the power to shield us from impending doom!</p>

<p>Also, tweet your positive eLiquid story and tag President Trump:</p>

<p>Be sure to share the above links with your friends!</p>



<p>At CloudChemistry, we have always valued the safety of our customers‚Äîand of ourselves! We all vape our eLiquid exclusively. That‚Äôs why we only source regulated, verified and tested materials for our flavor concentrate inventory. Quality and safety is of the utmost importance to us, and we strongly urge the vaping community at large to use only verified, tested materials in their eLiquid.</p>
