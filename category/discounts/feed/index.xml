					<description><![CDATA[We are pleased to offer to our customers this full-featured referral program, the latest addition to our expanding rewards roster.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="blog-post-intro">Our commitment to continually improving customer experience and happiness is the foundation upon which we are built.</p>
<p>Sadly, we have found this to be an increasingly less common attribute among companies in the modern marketplace. What&#8217;s even more unsettling, this ever lowering bar is viewed as the norm by the frustrated and disenfranchised modern consumer.</p>
<p>It is with this inspiration in mind that we are pleased to introduce our new full-featured <em>CloudFam Referral Program</em>.</p>
<h2>Give 10, Get 10&#8217;s</h2>
<ul>
<li>For every person who you refer to us, we offer them $10 in store credit on your behalf.</li>
<li>For each and every person you refer to us who becomes a paying customer, we give you $10 in store credit.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rules and restrictions</h2>
<p>There are only two requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, you must <a href="/my-account/">have an account</a>, and be logged in.</li>
<li>Second, you must be a paying customer.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Get started</h2>
<p>To get started referring, visit the <a href="/refer-a-friend/">Refer a Friend page</a>.</p>
<p>You can keep track of all of your referrals by clicking on the <a href="/my-account/referrals/">Referrals tab</a> in the My Account section.</p>
<h2>CloudFam Rewards</h2>
<p>This <em>Referral Program</em> is only the latest addition to the ever-expanding discount roster we are proud to offer to our loyal customers.</p>
<ul>
<li>10% cash back on every dollar you spend is deposited into your account as CloudCoins, redeemable on future purchases.</li>
<li>15% discount on every purchase for all active/retired: military, police, fire-fighters, first-responders, and EMS. If you&#8217;re one of these heroes, contact <strong>heroes at cloudchemistry [dot] co</strong> to get your discount code. You will be asked to produce ID.</li>
<li>15% discount on every purchase for college students. If you&#8217;re a college student, contact <strong>students at cloudchemistry [dot] co</strong> to get your discount code. You will be asked to produce ID.</li>
<li>Free shipping on orders over $50.</li>
<li>50 CloudCoins ($5) deposited to your account as soon as you sign up. (For new accounts only)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just the beginning. There is more coming soon.</p>
